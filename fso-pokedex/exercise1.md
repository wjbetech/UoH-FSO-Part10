# CI/CD Plan for Rust-Based Language Learning Application

## Language: Rust

## Application: Language Learning Application

CI Workflow in the Rust Ecosystem Linting: Use Clippy, the official Rust linter, as a starting point for catching common mistakes and enforcing idiomatic Rust.

Formatting: Use rustfmt to ensure consistent code formatting across the team.

Testing: Use cargo test to handle unit, integration, and documentation tests.

Building: Use cargo build --release to compile an optimized set of binaries, ensuring production readiness.

CI/CD Tools GitHub Actions is our default CI/CD solution because of its tight integration with GitHub and strong support for Rust. However, other alternatives include:

GitLab CI/CD

CircleCI

Drone CI

Unless someone on the team—especially those focused on CI/CD—has significant experience with an alternative, GitHub Actions will be the default.

Cloud-Based vs. Self-Hosted Choosing between cloud and self-hosted CI/CD requires evaluating several factors:

Cloud-Based: Easier to implement, scale, and maintain. Faster to get started and includes built-in security and integrations.

Self-Hosted: Offers more control over the environment, better suited for handling sensitive data or meeting regulatory requirements.

Key considerations include:

Team expertise

Budget

Infrastructure requirements

Deployment frequency

Security and compliance constraints
